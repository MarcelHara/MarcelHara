**`Game Developer Programmer`**

Im a Game Developer Programmer who started as an Artist. I made the switch from creating stunning 3D Art to Programming because I wanted to take the risk and see if I could do it. All my projects are built from nothing and made on my own or with a sophisticated team of friends.
